==== EconComp Integration ====

HIGH PRIORITY ( Required for basic functionality ) :

1. Add production tick system :
   - Calculate net resources per tick (prod - cons) for all InfInstances
   - Apply resource constraints (can't consume more than available)
   - Handle POWER as priority resource (affects other production)

2. Add population management :
   - Calculate population cap from HOUSING count
   - Track population consumption (FOOD per capita)
   - Starving population mechanism

3. Implement area management :
   - Track used area vs unused area
   - Prevent building when area exhausted

4. Implement assembly queue data structure in EconComp :
   - Consume PART resources to build queued infrastructure
   - Validate location compatibility via InfType.canBeBuilt()


MEDIUM PRIORITY :

1. Add location initialization for EconComp (set GROUND location initially)
2. Implement resource transport between EconLoc zones
3. Add efficiency modifiers (sunlight for SOLAR_PLANT / AGRONOMIC, etc)
4. Create update function for PlanetComp that ticks all EconComp locations


LOW PRIORITY :

1. Add storage capacity limits (commented out WAREHOUSE / BATTERY)
2. Implement power grid distribution system
3. Add tax / revenue mechanics for COMMERCE
