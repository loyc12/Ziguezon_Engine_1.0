==== EconComp Integration ====

HIGH PRIORITY ( Required for basic functionality ) :

1. Implement resource storage caps
  - Add per-resource storage capacity ( WAREHOUSE, ENERGY_BANKS )
  - Clamp after solver delta application
  - Add overflow decay or loss mechanics

2. Define inter-Econ transfer abstraction
  - Allow teleporting resources and infra from one econ to another ( for now )
  - Needed to boostarp econs where none exist prior

3. Implement assembly queue data structure in EconComp :
  - PART consumed over time
  - partial progress accumulation
  - InfType.canBeBuiltAt validation
  - optional build rate ( WORK limited ? )

4. Infrastructure maintenance resource sinks
  - Per-inf maintenance costs
  - Soft shutdown when unpaid (activity ratio scaling)
  - Hard decay when unpaid long-term (optional)

5. Artificial area infrastructure for orbit
  - HAB_MODULE / SPIN_HAB / CYLINDER / HABITAT / etc
  - Area increases via infra
  - Tie to pressurization rules


MEDIUM PRIORITY :

1. Add location initialization for EconComp (set GROUND location initially)
2. Implement true resource transport between econs
3. Implement efficiency modifiers (sunlight for SOLAR_PLANT / AGRONOMIC, etc)
4. Create update function for PlanetComp that ticks all EconComp locations


LOW PRIORITY :

1. Add storage capacity limits (commented out WAREHOUSE / BATTERY)
2. Add fractional carry buffers for res production ( avoid rounding losses )
3. Implement local res distribution system
4. Avoid giving pop priority access to food (?)
5. Add tax / revenue mechanics for COMMERCE and auto-trade
6. Allow work to be produced (ex : AGI infra via COMPUTE_CENTERS )
