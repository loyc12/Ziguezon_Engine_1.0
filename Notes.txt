================ ENGINE FEATURES TODO-LIST ================

TO REVIEW
 > move entity shapes to Utils ?
 > split sprite management from other ressources, since depends on an open window ?

UTILS ADDITIONS
 > re-add a way to log to files ( one per level + a global one ? )

CUSTOM RENDER LAYERS
 > RENDER QUEUE ( sort elements based on layer )
 > UI interaction priority based on layer

INPUT MANAGER ( FULL EVENT SYTEM ? )
 > OnKey
 > OnClick
 > TBD

PARTICLE MANAGER
 > Predefined & reusable particle buffer

ANIMATION MANAGER
 > holds disctinct fram instances
 > Animation speed / current state ?

UI MANAGER
 > Text, Button, Slider, etc



================ ZIGUEZON ENGINE DESIGN DOCUMENTATION ================

Ziguezon Engine aims at being a lightweight isometric 2D, narrow purpose game engine for personal game dev projects

It is build around having a limited lists of well defined features, and its design targets offering
a variety of logic modules, which can then be assembled into more complex systems based on the desired final game

This assembly is meant to be done via implementation of specific gameHooks functions ( see exampleGames folder ),
inside a gameHooks.zig file, the path of which is specified at compile time for the engine's use


Ziguezon will not aim to support any 3D, physics ( bare basic collision ), networking ( for now )

======== PRIMARY FEATURES ========

A simple hook interface, to inject code at various pre-defined points during the engine loop execution

Various utils, which serves specific purposes ( see utils folder and defs.zig ), such as :
 > logging functions     ( logger.zig )
 > math functions        ( mather.zig )
 > float angle wrapper   ( Angler.zig )
 > float Vectors         ( Vecter_.zig )
 > int Vectors           ( Coorder_.zig )
 > simple AABB structs   ( Boxer_.zig )
 > abstract drawcalls    ( drawer.zig )
 > abstract camera       ( camer.zig )
 > rng wrapper           ( randomer.zig )
 > ...

Various component systems with an associated manager :
 > entities              ( OK~ ) - to handle moveable game objects
 > tilemaps              ( OK~ ) - to handle semi-static game maps
 > particles             ( TBA ) - to handle render-only, non critical objects
 > event timers          ( WIP ) - to handle delays and durations
 > render layers         ( TBA ) - to handle render ordering
 > ressources system     ( WIP ) - to handle sound, musics, textures, etc
 > UI system             ( TBA ) - to handle user facing interfaces
 > animation system      ( TBA ) - to handle texture swaping
 > save and load system  ( TBA ) - to handle file interactions
 > input handler         ( TBA ) - abstract away from raylib's input system ???
